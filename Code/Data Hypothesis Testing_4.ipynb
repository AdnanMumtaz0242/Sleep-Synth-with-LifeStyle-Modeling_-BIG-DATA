A p-value of 0.9999516219309827 is extremely high, far above the common alpha level of 0.05 used to determine statistical significance.

This suggests that individuals experiencing more sleep disruptions tend to report lower sleep quality, indicating the detrimental impact of such disturbances on overall restorative sleep.\n",
